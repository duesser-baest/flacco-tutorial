# flacco Tutorial

This tutorial introduces you to the calculation of landscape features using the [**flacco** R package](https://github.com/kerschke/flacco).

The current version of the package can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flacco/). If you want to use the most recent (eventually not stable) version, you can obtain the developers version from [GitHub](https://github.com/kerschke/flacco).

You should have a look at the [Quick Start](quickstart.md) page in order to get to know the basics of **flacco**. If you need more detailed information, you should also check the other pages of this tutorial. They introduce concepts that are specific to the different kinds of features.
